# AI Diet Coach

AI Diet Coach is a personalized nutrition assistant that generates meal plans based on Rutgers University‚Äôs daily dining hall menu. It extracts the menu data from **Nutrislice**, parses it into JSON, and uses **Groq‚Äôs API with Llama 3.3-70B Versatile** to recommend what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The output includes a **full calorie, protein breakdown, and serving sizes** for the day.

## Features

* üçΩ **Daily Rutgers Dining Menu Parsing** ‚Äì pulls menu data from Nutrislice.
* ü§ñ **AI-Powered Recommendations** ‚Äì uses Llama 3.3-70B (via Groq API) for meal plan generation.
* üî¢ **Nutritional Insights** ‚Äì calculates total calories, protein, and macro breakdown.
* ü•ó **Personalized Suggestions** ‚Äì provides specific breakfast, lunch, and dinner recommendations.

## Tech Stack

* **Python** ‚Äì backend and parsing logic
* **Groq API** ‚Äì large language model inference
* **Llama 3.3-70B Versatile** ‚Äì core reasoning engine
* **JSON** ‚Äì structured menu data format

## Roadmap

* [ ] Fine-tune a model to act more as a specialized Diet Coach instead of using a LLM
* [ ] Allow for User's preferences to be changeable based on their goals of cutting or bulking/find their calorie count and protein intake based on height and weight
* [ ] Add fat and carb breakdown
* [ ] Support multiple universities via Nutrislice
* [ ] Export plans as PDF/CSV
* [ ] Build a simple web UI
